# Asset Pipeline

## What is it?
The asset pipeline provides a framework of concatenating and compressing your JavaScript and CSS assets. Instead of loading all of your JS and CSS files, only one JS and one CSS file are loaded.

## How is it included?
Via sprockets-rails gem

You can manually disable it upon rails app creation by executing the following on the command line:

rails new appname --skip-sprockets
